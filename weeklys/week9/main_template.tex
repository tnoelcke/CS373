		\section{Overview}
		This week we will be diving deeper in to mobile security. As we go through the lectures I will talk about sections of the lecture that I found interesting or insightful. I will also list out terms that I learned through out lecture this week.\\
		
		\section{Lecture Topics}
		    \subsection{History of Mobile networks}
		    First call using a cell phone was in April 3, 1973. I find this striking as this wasn't all that long ago that we didn't have cell phones. The first system that was used to send cell phone calls was 1g. 1g was bad. It didn't have many features and it had no security. The next generation of the cell phone network was 2g which was much better and implemented many more security features. Next was 2.5 G which allowed data to be transmitted of the cellar network. after 2g there was 3g which mostly implemented speed enhancements as well as 4g or LTE.\\
		    
		    \subection{history of mobile OS}
		     Mobile OS has an interesting history. Early on there were many players trying to get into the mobile OS world. The mobile OS world really started with a few key players. Palm, the people who made palm pilots, Microsoft, Symbian and RIM (black berry OS). One thing I find really interesting is that none of those players are still major players in the mobile market today. The big game changer that caused all of these other companies to become less popular was IOS. It is interesting to note however that IOS didn't capture the majority of the market share but rather caused a revolution in the way that people use smart phones. The other major player is google. Goolge actually started playing around with the idea of mobile OS before IOS was released however, IOS beat android to the market. Today however android has the majority of the market share.\\
		     
		     \subsection{Mobile OS Security Features}
		     In this section we will only be talking about the big 3 players in mobile OS today. Android, IOS and Windows. The different platforms have different security features. Android allows any one to create apps and will auto approve any app submitted to the app store. The registration costs for the app store is low. This allows for a divers pool of apps but also allows for apps that shouldn't be downloaded to slip through. The app permissions are managed statically. App isolation is done through sand-boxing and through permissions. Another interesting thing about android is that it allows third party installs.\\
		     
		     iOS on the other hand takes a much heavier hand in how apps are approved and distributed. IOS does not allow its apps to be deployed with out approval. The signing process is managed by Apple. The fee to use the public app store is 99 dollars per year. App permissions are dynamic meaning when they are used. It's also important to note that 3rd party installations are not allowed.\\
		     
		     Windows is much the same as IOS with only a few differences. The barrier to entry on Windows is lower much lower, 19 dollars. My guess would be because they just want people to write apps for windows phones. The app signing is also managed by windows much like Apple. The windows phones had a slightly different strategy for App isolation though. The windows approach was to have different permission levels for each type of app. The kernel and drivers have one permission level. System apps have another permission level and standard apps have another permission level.\\
		     
		     \subsection{Security Bypasses}
		     There are several security bypasses for Android and iOS. In iOS the main security bypass is actually done by the user on purpose. This is done to run software or code that is not authorized by apple. This is called jail breaking. This can also be done to Unlock carrier-locked IPhones. Some times this is also done by attackers to take advantage of exploits in mobile browsers.\\
