		This week we will be diving deeper in to mobile security. As we go through the lectures I will talk about sections of the lecture that I found interesting or insightful. I will also list out terms that I learned through out lecture this week.\\

		    \subsection{History of Mobile networks}
		    First call using a cell phone was in April 3, 1973. I find this striking as this wasn't all that long ago that we didn't have cell phones. The first system that was used to send cell phone calls was 1g. 1g was bad. It didn't have many features and it had no security. The next generation of the cell phone network was 2g which was much better and implemented many more security features. Next was 2.5 G which allowed data to be transmitted of the cellar network. after 2g there was 3g which mostly implemented speed enhancements as well as 4g or LTE.\\
