		\section{Overview}
		In this write up I will talk about the Hack the Box challenge. I will describe how I obtained an invite code and registered. I will then discuss the three challenges that I chose to complete. In each section I will discuss the steps I took to complete the challenge including figures and code samples where applicable.\\
			
		\section{Obtaining an Invite Code}
		To start this project I visited the hack the box website. Once at the website I found the registration site for individuals. The page indicated that I would need to hack the page in order to obtain an invite code. The first thing I did was start examining the sources for the web page. I then noticed that there was file called inviteapi.min.js. This is a minified JS file.\\
		
		Using the dev tools on the browser I viewed this file. Initially, It was only five lines long and hard to look at. Using the dev tools I pretty printed the file to make the file more readable. I then noticed that it looked like this file was exporting some functions. The frist thing I tried to do was to evaluate this code in the console. This however gave me an undefined result. However, One of the functions that I noticed that this file was generating was makeInviteCode(). I looked at the arguments for this function using the console and found that this function didn't take any arguments. I called this function and it returned an object much like the object below.\\
		
		I noticed that this object had a odd looking string along with a compression algorithm. In this case it was base64. I took this string and decoded it using base64 and found that it was a message. The message stated: "In order to generate the invite code, make a POST request to /api/invite/generate". Next I used post man to make a post request to the end point that it suggested. Again I got a compressed string. I decoded this string also using base64 and was given an activation code kind of like a windows activation code. I entered this into the activation code box and found that it took me to the next screen to register.\\
