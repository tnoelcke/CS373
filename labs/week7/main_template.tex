		\section{Google}
		I started by looking for web sites that contain the word google or sites that might look like google. I assigned a penalty to any sites that contain google in them. This is because it is one of the most visited sites on the internet. As such it is a likely target for spoofing and fakes of many kinds. To counteract this for actual google sites I made the penalty for having google in the name less than the threshold as just having google in the name doesn't mean that it is bad.\\
		
		\section{Alexa rank}
		Initially, I tried to assign a penalty for not having an Alexa rank. However, I found that this adversely impacted my error rate for detecting sites that weren't malicious but were labeled as such by my program. I ended up assigning no penalty for not having an Alexa rank but did assign a bonus for sites that were in the top million. This would also help counteract the google penalty I mentioned earlier.\\
		
		\section{Site Age}
		Initially, I set a penalty on any site that was younger that 180 days. However, I fond that I was still having errors on some sites that should have been detected but were not. I ended up setting a penalty on any site younger than one year old. This is because sites that are younger are generally more malicious than sites that have been around for a while.\\
		
		\section{IP}
		If the site didn't return an IP address were also given a penalty. I gave these sites a penalty that would cause them to fail if they could not also earn a bonus some where else either via Alexa ranking or via scheme. This is because urls that don't return ip addresses tend to be malicious and I would like to assume that these are guilty until proven innocent.\\
		
		\section{scheme}
		One of the first things that I decided to do was to give a bonus to sites that use the https scheme. Using https won't keep a domain from being detected but rather gives them a little credit for at least trying. I did this because https does ensure that there is some security built in to the site. I didn't just pass these urls along because though this does add some security it also possible to buy a certificate and serve up malicious content that is signed.\\
		
		\section{file type}
		I also assigned some penalties based on file type. I originally tried to asses a penalty for using JS files but I found this lead to a lot of false positives. For detecting JS code that is bad it may be better to use some other means of detection. I did however assign a heavy penalty to exe files as these are likely to contain malicious code. I also assigned  a slight penalty to aspx, asp, xml and de files as these are another way that malicious content may be delivered. However these file types were not assesed a penalty large enough to disqualify them outright unlike exe files.\\
